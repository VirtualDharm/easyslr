Dashboard, Task Management, User Profile, Project Tracking

1. Dashboard Design:
We'll create a central dashboard that provides an overview of ongoing projects, individual tasks, deadlines, and team collaborations.
Implement components like task lists, project timelines, and any other relevant widgets for the dashboard.
2. Task Management Interface:
Design an intuitive interface for task creation, assignment, and tracking.
Include features like setting deadlines, priorities, assigning team members, and adding task descriptions.
3. User Profile and Project Settings:
Build a user profile section where team members can manage their information and preference settings.
4. Project Tracking and Reporting:
Develop interactive visualizations for project tracking.
Use a PDF viewer to see the report and download it (using a mock PDF URL for now).
